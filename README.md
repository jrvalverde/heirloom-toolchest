##The Heirloom Project
This is a mirror of [The Heirloom Project](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net) CVS repositories —
a collection of hisorical UNIX tools,  
principally derived from System V, which have been patched to build on a modern system.

Particularly noteworthy are its historical Bourne shell, toolchain, and source code management tools —  
it includes some of the original implementations of m4, lex, yacc, SCCS, troff, etc.  

Also included here are the related original [vi](http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net)  and [nail](http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/mailx.html) (mailx) repositories.
